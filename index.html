          ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created
          from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by
          Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of
          communication between humans and machines, Eliza simulated conversation
          by using a "pattern matching" and substitution methodology that gave
          users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had
          no built in framework for contextualizing events. ELIZA's creator,
          Weizenbaum, regarded the program as a method to show the superficiality
          of communication between man and machine, but was surprised by the
          number of individuals who attributed human-like feelings to the computer
          program, including Weizenbaum's secretary. Many academics believed that
          the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many
          people, particularly those with psychological issues, and that it could
          aid doctors working on such patients' treatment.
